How to move a full Git repository
 

If you're wrangling multiple Git repositorites, you'll eventually want to move files from one to another. This tutorial will show you how you can move a full Git repository from one remote server to another. The steps below even allow you to choose which branches and tags to include.

Letâ€™s call the original repository ORI and the new one NEW, here are the steps required to copy everything from ORI to NEW:

1. Create a local repository in the temp-dir directory using:

git clone <url to ORI repo> temp-dir
clone ori repository
2. Go into the temp-dir directory.

3. To see a list of the different branches in ORI do:

git branch -a
git branch-a
4. Checkout all the branches that you want to copy from ORI to NEW using:

git checkout branch-name
checkout-branches
5. Now fetch all the tags from ORI using:

git fetch --tags
git-fetch-tags
6. Before doing the next step make sure to check your local tags and branches using the following commands:

git tag
git branch -a
git-tag-and-git-branch-a
7. Now clear the link to the ORI repository with the following command:

git remote rm origin
8. Now link your local repository to your newly created NEW repository using the following command:

git remote add origin <url to NEW repo>
9. Now push all your branches and tags with these commands:

git push origin --all
git push --tags
end-result
10. You now have a full copy from your ORI repo.
